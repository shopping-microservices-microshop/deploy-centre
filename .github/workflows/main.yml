# This GitHub Actions workflow automates the creation of a complete
# Kubernetes and GitOps environment on an AWS EC2 instance.
#
# It uses Terraform to provision the infrastructure and then executes
# a series of scripts to configure everything from the runner to Argo CD
# and the monitoring stack.
